# Web. Tic-tac-toe, calculator.

The task consists of two parts.

1) Implement the tic-tac-toe game discussed in the lesson.

2) Implement a calculator in JavaScript. You need to modify the page template (see files). The template contains the HTML code of the page and implements some script functions. You need to write styles to make the page look "pretty", as well as add the missing parts of the script to make the calculator work. To do this, you need to set click event handlers to the buttons of the calculator, and also implement the "evaluate" function, which evaluates the value of an arithmetic expression written in reverse Polish notation (there are detailed explanations in the script file). The calculator should calculate correct arithmetic expressions consisting of numbers, operators +, -, *, /, and brackets. There is no need to check for the correctness of the expression entered by the user.

JavaScript's built-in eval function cannot be used!

On the main page of the laboratory work (index.html), you need to place links to the pages with the tic-tac-toe game and to the page with the calculator.
